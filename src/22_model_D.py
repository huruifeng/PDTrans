### Dx model design:
* DA. the input data is gene expression data of current visit, current UPDRS, gene expression data of 1 previous visit, 1 previous UPDRS, the output data is UPDRS of next visit
  * -- the model is to predict the UPDRS of next visit
  * -- current expression data + current UPDRS + 1 previous expression data + 1 previous UPDRS -> next UPDRS

* DB. the input data is gene expression data of current visit, current UPDRS, gene expression data of 1 previous visit, 1 previous UPDRS, time period until next visit, the output data is UPDRS of next visit
  * -- the model is to predict the UPDRS of next visit
  * -- current expression data + current UPDRS + 1 previous expression data + 1 previous UPDRS + time period -> next UPDRS
* <u>DB is the most general model design for Dx model, and it can be used for both DA and DB by setting the time period as 0 for DA </u>
  * Prepare a data table with columns: expression data, current UPDRS, 1 previous expression data, 1 previous UPDRS, time period until next visit, UPDRS of next visit
